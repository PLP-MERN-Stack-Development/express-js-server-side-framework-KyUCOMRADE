# üöÇ Express.js RESTful API Assignment

This assignment focuses on building a **RESTful API** using Express.js, implementing proper routing, middleware, error handling, and advanced features like filtering, pagination, and search.

---

## üìò 1. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)  
- npm or yarn  
- Postman, Insomnia, or curl for API testing  

### Installation

1. Clone your GitHub Classroom repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PLP-MERN-Stack-Development/express-js-server-side-framework-KyUCOMRADE/commit/8e1842df6f76fc39be523ea9b5f57d0b9b790b43
cd express-js-side-framework-KyUCOMRADE
```

2. Install dependencies:  
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:  
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
You can optionally change the `AUTH_TOKEN` in `.env`.

4. Run the server:  
```bash
npm start
```

By default, the server runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## üîë 2. Authentication

Protected routes (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) require a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>
```

Default token (from `.env.example`):  
```
secret123
```

## üß© 3. API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| GET | `/api/products` | Get all products (supports filtering, search, pagination) | ‚ùå |
| GET | `/api/products/:id` | Get a specific product by ID | ‚ùå |
| POST | `/api/products` | Create a new product | ‚úÖ |
| PUT | `/api/products/:id` | Update a product | ‚úÖ |
| DELETE | `/api/products/:id` | Delete a product | ‚úÖ |
| GET | `/api/products/stats` | Get product statistics by category | ‚ùå |
