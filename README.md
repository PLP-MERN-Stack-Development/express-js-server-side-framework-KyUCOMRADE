# Express.js RESTful API Assignment

This assignment focuses on building a RESTful API using Express.js, implementing proper routing, middleware, and error handling.

## Assignment Overview

You will:
1. Set up an Express.js server
2. Create RESTful API routes for a product resource
3. Implement custom middleware for logging, authentication, and validation
4. Add comprehensive error handling
5. Develop advanced features like filtering, pagination, and search

## Getting Started

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment invitation
2. Clone your personal repository that was created by GitHub Classroom
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Files Included

- `Week2-Assignment.md`: Detailed assignment instructions
- `server.js`: Starter Express.js server file
- `.env.example`: Example environment variables file

## Requirements

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Postman, Insomnia, or curl for API testing

## API Endpoints

The API will have the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/products`: Get all products
- `GET /api/products/:id`: Get a specific product
- `POST /api/products`: Create a new product
- `PUT /api/products/:id`: Update a product
- `DELETE /api/products/:id`: Delete a product

## Submission

Your work will be automatically submitted when you push to your GitHub Classroom repository. Make sure to:

1. Complete all the required API endpoints
2. Implement the middleware and error handling
3. Document your API in the README.md
4. Include examples of requests and responses

# üöÇ Express.js RESTful API Assignment

This assignment focuses on building a **RESTful API** using Express.js, implementing proper routing, middleware, error handling, and advanced features like filtering, pagination, and search.

## üìò 1. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)  
- npm or yarn  
- Postman, Insomnia, or curl for API testing  

### Installation

1. Clone your GitHub Classroom repository:  
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>
```

2. Install dependencies:  
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:  
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
You can optionally change the `AUTH_TOKEN` in `.env`.

4. Run the server:  
```bash
npm start
```

By default, the server runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## üîë 2. Authentication

Protected routes (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) require a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>
```

Default token (from `.env.example`):  
```
secret123
```

## üß© 3. API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| GET | `/api/products` | Get all products (supports filtering, search, pagination) | ‚ùå |
| GET | `/api/products/:id` | Get a specific product by ID | ‚ùå |
| POST | `/api/products` | Create a new product | ‚úÖ |
| PUT | `/api/products/:id` | Update a product | ‚úÖ |
| DELETE | `/api/products/:id` | Delete a product | ‚úÖ |
| GET | `/api/products/stats` | Get product statistics by category | ‚ùå |
